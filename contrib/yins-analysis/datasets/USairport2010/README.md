### Description ###

This dataset is the complete US airport network in 2010. This is the network used in the first part of the [Why Anchorage is not (that) important: Binary ties and Sample selection](http://toreopsahl.com/2011/08/12/why-anchorage-is-not-that-important-binary-ties-and-sample-selection/)-blog post. The data is downloaded from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Transtats site ([Table T-100; id 292](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=292)) with the following filters: Geography=all; Year=2010; Months=all; and columns: Passengers, Origin, Dest. Based on this table, the [airport codes](http://opsahl.co.uk/tnet/datasets/USairport_2010_codes.txt) are converted into id numbers, and the weights of duplicated ties are summed up. Also ties with a weight of 0 are removed (only cargo), and self-loops removed.
